	<p>Storm has the ability to control the elemental forces that preside over weather. She can create winds strong enough to support her weight, which then gives her the ability to fly. Storm draws her power out from the center of the earthâ€™s electromagnetic field, this allows her to create lightning, tornados, blizzards, and massive maelstroms.</p>
